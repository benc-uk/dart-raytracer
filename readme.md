## Dart Raytracer

An experiment to create a classic raytracer in Dart (also cross compiled to Javascript).
All the classes for matrix, vector, math, lighting and raytracing coded from scratch, no libaries used. I like to make life really painful.

Project was abandoned in 2014.

#### Possible project resurection ideas

- Use YAML rather than JSON for scene defintion, as parsing wasn't as clean as I hoped and writting JSON freehand is awful
- Multiple lights
- Cylinders and cubes
- Modern raytracing techniques
